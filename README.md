I compiled my other addons into a single addon so I won't have to update multiple projects.

AddOns:

BigButtons - 'A farm tool for Sunsong Ranch.'
Dragon Overlay - 'Provides an overlay on UnitFrames for Boss, Elite, Rare and RareElite'
Enhanced Config (Tukui Ace3 Config for all my projects)
Enhanced Friends List - 'Provides Friends List Customization'
Enhanced Shadows (Does not work in SLE & ChaoticUI) - 'Adds options for registered shadows'
Square Minimap Buttons/Bar - 'Minimap Button Bar / Minimap Button Skinning'
Loot Confirm - 'Confirms Loot for Solo/Groups (Need/Greed/Disenchant)'
Movable Frames - 'Make Blizzard Frames Movable'
stAddonManager - 'A simple and minimalistic addon to disable/enabled addons without logging out.'

You can enable / disable these addons in the ProjectAzilroka section in the config.

If it isn't in the list in the config then it's disabled automatically.
