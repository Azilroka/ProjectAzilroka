# FriendGroups
This is modified [Friend Groups](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/friend-groups/) addon (World of Warcraft) that is working with 7.1.

This addon is belongs to frankkkkk who is the original author. After the addon survived for more than 2 years, after the last official updated at Oct. 29. 2013, it finally stopped working with the newest battle.net [changes in Blizzard's 6.2.4 API](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742784697). I modified it to make it work, at least for me.

LUA and XML is never my master programming languages, I can understand it but I never got time to learn and understand the WoW API, I want to but my time table is tight with real life. So this is just a fix not an "improved" version. It just looks like what it should be without new features (hopefully it is what it supposed to be like...)
